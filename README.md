# SubletHub
SubletSphere is a mobile app that helps college students sublet their apartments or dorms during the summer to other students interning or studying nearby. Users can browse sublets by location, price, and availability, and find the contact information of the student subletting if they want to discuss further.

The frontend of the app is built using SwiftUI (SubletHub folder), and Firebase backend (server folder) is written in Javascript and deployed on Google CLI.
